            <p>Poor little Adam. Always surrounded by problems. Always surrounded by cowards and slackers. &quot;Oh god shall fix this&quot; they say &quot;Oh god wills this&quot; they cry</p>
<p>But there is no god? Or perhaps a cruel one? Maybe he's asleep. Time for immortals passes differently for mortals. A fly lives for 3 days, where humans can live for a centuary. Maybe we live in a time where god sleeps and there are no miracles. Maybe god is dead and we live in a world beyond its divinity</p>
<p>Perhaps. But anyways. Adam had no choice but to fix whatever he faced. Leave it to god? Oof the apocalypse will happen sooner than this problem get fixed. But alas Adam is still a child. He is sometimes powerless and helpless. Its a crushing feeling is it not. One that makes an awful mark on the mind and soul</p>
<p>Sometimes adam is lucky and others help him. He remembers this genirosity deeply. He wants to pay it forward. He knows that awful sickening feeling of being powerless. He recognizes it in others and wants to lift them out of it</p>
<p>Some people are bent and helping them to straighten up and get back on their feet works. Others are broken. Trying to touch then wounds you.</p>
