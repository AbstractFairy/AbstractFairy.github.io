            <h1>Are you Chasing a Symbol? Seek what the master sought</h1>
<img src="This is not a pipe.png" alt="Ce n'est pas un pipe, aka The Treachery of Images">
<p>tl;dr: there are many times where people think they are pursuing something, when in reality they are actually pursuing a symbol of that thing—which can be problematic because symbols tend to drift and distort over time to the point where they aren't even related to the original thing. You can learn to recognize/intuit this, and go seek the original thing. This has a lot of implications, e.g. wtf is impostor syndrome and how to resolve it</p>
<p>Generally speaking, it's quite common for people to lose track of the thing they're chasing in favour of the symbol. Which is a problem when the symbol gets distorted. At its most extreme a symbol can become a simulacra without an original.</p>
<ul>
<li>S1: thing itself</li>
<li>S2: symbol of thing (faithful)</li>
<li>S3: distorted symbol</li>
<li>S4: symbol so distorted it has no relation to reality.</li>
</ul>
<p>(For clarification S1 is just a convenient short hand for saying simulacra level 1)</p>
<p>Ok, that's too abstract. Lets give a more concrete example instead</p>
<h2>Imposter Syndrome is a result of Symbols</h2>
<ul>
<li>s1: can you do x (very specific thing)</li>
<li>s2: can you do x (broadly)</li>
<li>s3: are you the type of person who can do x</li>
<li>s4: are you [role]? (the question of doing the thing is not even relevant, just are you this role or not)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can't resolve imposter syndrome because it has no original. You're asking whether or not you are a very undefined role.</p>
<p>You can answer whether or not you can do a specific things. You can answer whether or not you can do a defined set of things. You can adopt a label of being the type of person who can resolve a defined set of problems but how the fuck can you honestly and confidently adopt an undefined label?</p>
<p><em>(For honesty's sake, I must point out that this is loosely based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulacra_and_Simulation">Simulacra and Simulation</a> by sociologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Baudrillard">Jean Baudrillard</a>—and also rather ironically, I do not understand his work, and that my version is probably substantially different from his, especially at S4)</em></p>
<h2>Disembodied Action</h2>
<p>disembodied action is a result of simulacrum levels</p>
<ul>
<li>you go from doing the thing</li>
<li>to doing what you think the thing is (&quot;trying&quot;)</li>
<li>to doing what people tell you the thing is</li>
<li>to identifying with the thing even if you don't do it</li>
</ul>
<p>a writer simply writes. Instead of writing people talk about writing, talk about what makes great writing (no writing is done) and eventually the even drop the writing entirely, and start talking about writers and who are great writers (even less writing is done)</p>
<p>replace writing/writers with art/artists or whatever your chosen profession or choice of activity is</p>
<p><strong>You cannot complete an action on the wrong simulacrum level, and attempting to do so will lead to endless frustration. Notice whether you want to do the thing, or if you're just chasing a symbol</strong></p>
<p>This is why most self help books do not work they try to sell you an identity—a symbol of the thing. That symbol can be unfaithful—distorting reality or that symbol can be unreal—pointing to nothing in reality. Just a symbol pointing to nothing, or to other symbols.</p>
<h2>Noticing the symbols</h2>
<p>Ok, so at this point you might be wondering how can we notice the symbols and go chase the actual thing? This is relatively hard.</p>
<p><strong>The easiest heuristic is to try and list or imagine a tangible before and after. What has tangibly, visibly changed in the real world? Not just labels. And generally speaking, do <em>Not</em> copy the masters, Seek what the masters sought!</strong></p>
<p>You can also try doing Gendlin's Focusing (which I've written about <a href="https://www.abstractfairy.xyz/focusing-gendlin">here</a>,) to get some more clarity via your felt sense / bodily ways of knowing.</p>
<p>A slightly longer/harder route is learning about the Buddhist concept of Emptiness—which is very very different from the western notion of emptiness, and also Buddhist Emptiness is quite literally an anti-meme. Examples below</p>
<h2>Emptiness of symbols and concepts</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>You know when you're into someone and you start interacting with the image you have of them instead of interacting with them? E.g. thinking they're perfect or that getting with them will solve all your problems</p>
<p>Turns out we do that with everything</p>
<p>E.g. you see a chair and you forget you can use this lump of wood for other things than sitting on it You walk into a room and you know what everything can be used for You go to work and you play the role you always play because other options slipped your mind</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(^ tweets from a locked account. This is what made emptiness click for me intellectually)</p>
<p><strong>Basically, we actively create and project concepts onto our perceptions. Once you are aware of this you can notice it and choose whether or not this is the best way of looking at the thing.</strong></p>
<h2>Concepts biting you in the ass</h2>
<p>Our concepts usually work most of the time. But sometimes they can come back and bite us in the ass.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Imagine that one day when out walking you turn a street corner and suddenly hear a loud and menacing growling nearby. A ferocious and hungry-looking tiger appears in front of you seemingly about to leap. The distress of a reaction of terror there would be quite understandable. But if you notice on closer inspection that this tiger is not real, that it is actually a holographic projection with accompanying sound recording from a nearby hologram projector, the fear and the problem simply dissolve.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Let’s elaborate our illustration of the holographic tiger slightly differently to draw out this aspect of emptiness. Imagine that you enter a room that is dark except for a lamp in one corner. There you see your friend, huddled next to the lamp in a state of great anxiety and staring transfixed at the wall opposite. “A wolf! A wolf!”, he is whimpering in fear. Turning to look at the wall, you see a large silhouette of a wolf but very quickly realize that it is just the shadow of your friend’s hands, cast by the lamplight on the wall. In his fear he is completely unaware of his hands or how he is holding them, or the fact that the wolf shape is merely their shadow. What will you say to him?</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Try to differentiate whether you're chasing the thing itself, or a symbol of it.</p>
<p>Try to be aware of how symbols drift away from their original thing. Goodhart's law is a perfect example of this. &quot;When a measure becomes a goal, it ceases to be a good measure.&quot;</p>
<p>Personally, I prefer to try and keep discussions grounded. A bad discussion will have too many symbols and abstractions that don't ground out into anything (academics seem especially guilty of this imo). To resolve this, ask for tangible examples, ask for them to ELI5.</p>
<p>Seek what the masters sought directly, don't imitate their forms</p>
<p>There's a really funny parable about a group of monks and a cat. Whenever the monks prayed, the cat would come in and disturb their prayers. The head monk eventually got sick of this and ordered the cat to be tied up whenever they pray. The days went by, and the monks prayed every day and every day they would tie the cat up while they prayed. As the days went by, the head monk grew old and died. His students continued to pray, and continued to tie up the cat whenever they prayed. As the days went by, the cat also grew old and died, so the monks went and got a new cat to continue tying up the cat while they prayed. Generations past and scholars would sing praise about the importance of tying up a cat while you prayed.</p>
<p>You do not need to set out to get a cat to tie up while you pray.</p>
